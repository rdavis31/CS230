# CS230 Module Eight Journal

## Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The Gaming Room is a client focused on delivering engaging multiplayer experiences across platforms. They requested a scalable, secure game called Draw It or Lose It, which supports real-time drawing challenges, session persistence, and cross-device compatibility. The software needed to be modular, maintainable, and capable of handling concurrent users with minimal latency.

## What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I excelled at synthesizing complex requirements into a clear, structured design document. This included platform evaluations, security architecture, and UML diagrams that mapped out system behavior. I also integrated peer feedback and citation practices to ensure the documentation was both technically rigorous and client-ready.

## What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

The design document served as a blueprint that clarified architectural decisions before implementation. It helped identify edge cases, align technical choices with user needs, and streamline development by reducing ambiguity. Having a well-defined structure made it easier to delegate tasks and maintain consistency across modules.

## If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would revisit the distributed storage and session recovery section. While it covered the essentials, I’d enhance it with more detailed failure scenarios and fallback strategies. Adding flow diagrams and concrete examples would improve clarity and better support resilience planning.

## How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

User needs were interpreted through gameplay scenarios, platform constraints, and client feedback. These insights shaped decisions around UI responsiveness, intuitive game flow, and secure session management. Designing with the user in mind ensures the software is not only functional but also enjoyable and accessible, which is critical for adoption and long-term engagement.

## How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

I approached the design using modular architecture, platform analysis, and iterative refinement. Techniques included UML modeling, security-first planning, and collaborative peer review. For future projects, I’d incorporate early-stage prototyping, automated design validation, and user journey mapping to accelerate development and improve alignment with client goals.
